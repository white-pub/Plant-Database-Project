The goal of this project is to digitize a large collection of pressed
plants for the biology department. The website should be highly
searchable, easy to navigate, and include all the relevant
information on the plants. The project itself is not too
complicated, mostly data entry is required. Additional tools can
be exporting the data as a CSV, but the core is a searchable plant
database.
